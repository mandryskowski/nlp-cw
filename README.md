# How to run the model

Run **all** cells in the following sections, in this order:
1. "Download my final submitted model"
2. "Fetch data"
3. "Load data"
4. "Tokenization"
5. "Threshold tuning"
6. "Dev and test set prediction"

This code was tested on Google Colab.
You do not need to set up any files locally other than the notebook itself.
The notebook will download required data and python modules.
